HOW TO COMPILE
1) type in javac *.java and enter
2) type in java LinkedListDriver.java (input file name)
from there should be able to use all commands perfectly

merge operation explination:
we create a temporary list for storing the values the user inputs
then we merge those by inserting each nodes identical portions and then the rest of the nodes which are not equivalent to eachother
Big O(n)
intersection explination:
scan in length and elements of new node and insert into a new list we, then find common elements via while looping through original and checking for equivalence
adding to common newlist and printing
Big O(n)
